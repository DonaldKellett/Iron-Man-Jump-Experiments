        <p>Click on the folders to download the code!  You can play around with it, and if you are a keen coder, you can try and mess with the code.  Made some interesting changes?  Email me at <a href="mailto:dleung@connect.kellettschool.com">dleung@connect.kellettschool.com</a>!  If I think the changes you made to the game are worth posting, I might add it to this repo with <strong>your name</strong> on the copyright!</p>

        <h3>Experiment Details</h3>

        <p><em>The Iron Man Jump Experiments below are the original experiments provided by <a href="http://donaldkellett.github.io">DonaldKellett</a>.</em></p>

        <h4>Iron Man Jump with Score Limits (Experiment 0)</h4>

        <p>This version of Iron Man Jump was originally created for <a href="http://kellettjainnovision.github.io">Innovision</a> as an incentive for people to buy shares.  Later on, I sent this to <a href="http://harrystreatfield.github.io">Harry Streatfield</a> as a challenge for him to find out the line(s) of code responsible for the score limit. <br /> In theory, once you reach 1000 points, the game automatically stops you from scoring more by killing the character.  However, in reality, when the character is falling, it still (for some reason) gains a few points before showing the game over screen. <br /> <b style="font-weight: bold;">There is actually an online version of this game on the Innovision site.  Click <a href="http://kellettjainnovision.github.io/secret_page_demo">here</a> to play it online!</b></p>

        <h4>Experiment 1 - Increasing Gravity Mode</h4>

        <p>In this version of Iron Man Jump, everything is normal at the start.  However, as you keep playing, the gravity gradually gets stronger and stronger until it is impossible to reach the next platform.  I have played it a lot of times, and the maximum score someone can get before the gravity gets too strong is somewhere between 1000 and 2000 points.</p>

        <h4>Experiment 2 - Decreasing Gravity Mode</h4>

        <p>This version of Iron Man Jump is the exact opposite of Experiment 1 - as you play the game the gravity decreases.  Once you start, things can only get easier!</p>

        <h4>Experiment 3 - Swapped Keyboard Controls</h4>

        <p>In this version, the left and right control keys are swapped (i.e. pressing the left key makes the character go right and vice versa) to confuse you.  See how long you can survive!</p>

        <h4>Experiment 4 - Swapped Keyboard Controls 2</h4>

        <p>This version is even harder and wackier!  All the main keyboard controls are swapped - see if you can figure out which key is which!  It might take a few practices to get used to playing this mode.</p>

        <h4>Experiment 5 - Hold Key Mode</h4>

        <p>In this version, the keyboard controls are back to normal.  However, once you press a control, the computer automatically holds it for you.  This version tests you ability to time your movements correctly.  How long can you survive?</p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
